ARTICLE ON "How to mitigate impact of Covid-19 on your study abroad plans?" 
INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
 Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. 
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. 
Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). 
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. 
MITIGATION
1.AVOIDING THE COUNTRIES AFFECTED ON A LARGE SCALE. 
2.WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE VIRUS TO REDUCE. 
3.PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING AT THE INSTITUTION OF STUDY EVEN AFTER THE DECREASING OF THE VIRUS. 
4.MASK,SANITIZIER TO BE KEPT IN HANDY. 
5.SEARCHING FOR SIMILAR COURSES ONLINE WHICH CAN BE DONE WITHIN HOME DURING LOCKDOWN. 
CONCLUSION
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease. 
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers. 
In March, the World Health Organisation initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy. 
There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. 
To minimise the harm from misinformation, medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to retractions and other updates.
